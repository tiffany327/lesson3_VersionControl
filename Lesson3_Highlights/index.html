            </h2>
            <p class="lead">VCS stands for Version Control System. It was formally known as Revision control or source control management. It is important for developers, designers, or pretty much anyone that works in an arena of document or project creation to be able to manage and assess the timeline of the project/document. This becomes especially important when working collaboratively on a project with a team. VCS enables users to manage the various versions of a project while members simultaneously work on the project without overwriting files. The VCS provides one repository for files in a system where members "check out" committed files for modification.Once modifications are complete members "check files back in" or commit them back to the repository. Versions of the files/project can be merged so that nothing is overwritten and all changes are noted.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two types of repositories in Version Control Systems. A remote repository is located on a remote server and can be shared between team members. A local repository is on the individual machine of the user. Version control systems allow for data files to be pushed and pulled back and forth between the remote repository and the local repository. Local repositories can be created by either creating a new repository or by cloning an existing repository. These local repositories allow users to be able to work on files that are pulled from the remote repository at the same time as their team members.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">What is GIT?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a distributed version control system that is free and open source and used by many large and popular corporations. It remains a popular file sharing solution because of its speed, ability to back up your files and because it is distributed, allowing for users to simultaneously work on the same project files without overwriting content. Like other version control systems, GIT maintains a complete revision history that includes who changed the files, what changes were made, and when the changes were made. It also allows users to merge changes into the same file. You can also revert files/projects back to previous versions. With GIT, there is no single point of failure and everything is local so users have a complete copy of the repository data stored locally on their computer.</p>

                <span class="text-muted">Key Stages & Sections of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Files in GIT reside in 3 main states. Files are either committed, modified, or staged. When a file is committed, the date is stored securely in the local database. Modified files reflect changes in the data files but the files have not yet been committed back to the database. Staged files have been marked complete and ready for the next commit snapshot. 

There are 3 main sections of a GIT project. The working directory is also known as the working tree. Files are pulled from the database and into the working directory for modifications. Once the changes are made, the user stages only the changes that he/she wishes to be part of the next commit. 

The staging area is sort of like a holding area for the information that will be part of the next commit. The .git directory is the repository where staged information is committed.

                <span class="text-muted">Common GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT functions with commands, much like the old dos based computers. Common commands include git init, git add –all, git commit –am ‘Initial commit, git log, and git status. Common remote commands include git remote, git pull, and git push. The most widely used commands and the three basic steps in GIT are add, commit, and push. All of these commands are related to the distribution of data between the local and remote repositories. Viewing, moving, modifying reviewing, committing, staging, comparing the difference between staged and unstaged files, and checking the status of data files can all be done with the proper GIT commands.</p>
